        <h1>Egg Festival</h1>
        <p>The Egg Festival takes place on the 13th of every Spring. The player attends the festival by entering Pelican Town Square between 9am and 2pm. When the festival ends, the player is returned to The Farm at 10pm.

            The featured attraction of the Egg Festival is the Egg Hunt. The player and some other villagers search for small colored eggs hidden around Pelican Town. The Egg Hunt starts by talking to Mayor Lewis. The player must gather 9 colored eggs (in 50 seconds, real time), or else Abigail will win. (In multiplayer games, less than 9 eggs are required to win, and more than one player can win at the same time.) If they win, they will receive a Straw Hat as a reward the first year they win, and a Prize Ticket afterwards.
            
            There is a booth set up where the player can purchase a decorative Lawn Flamingo, Plush Bunny, Seasonal Plants, Strawberry Seeds, and other items. (Planting the strawberry seeds on or before Spring 16, will allow the player to harvest Strawberries two times before Summer).
            
            The festival ends after Mayor Lewis announces the winner of the Egg Hunt.</p>
